- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobMcZag, aka Roberto Zagni
- 👀 I’m interested in using Software Engineering principles to build maintainable Data Platforms.
- 📘 I wrote the book ["Data engineering with dbt" (and Snowflake)](https://a.co/d/73aH1Py) published by Packt Publishing.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring how to better organize the refined layer in DWH.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything about modern data management in the cloud.
  Some buzzwords: DevOps/DataOps, Data Vault, ML/AI, dbt, Unified Star Schema, building and coaching data teams, Kafka and more ...
